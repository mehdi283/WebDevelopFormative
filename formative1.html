    <h1>A Regular Ramadan Day in My Life</h1>
    <p>Ramadan is distinguished as a month of self-discipline,<br>
 self-examination and loyalty, which makes it special. In<br>
 order to follow the fasting schedule, I had to completely<br>
  change my daily routine. I am interested to share what my<br>
   days often include during this holy month. </p><br><hr>

    

    
    <h2>Early Morning Suhoor routine </h2>

    <p>In the morning I wake up really early; I wake up at 3AM in the morning and start<br>reciting the Quran till 4:30. It is a beautiful time in the morning for sincere reflection<br>and profound communion. 

        Afterward, I have Suhoor and make certain to eat well so<br> my energy lasts throughout the day; After having Suhoor, I brush my teeth and pray Fajr. Then i<br> sleep till 5:30 AM. </p><br>

  <h3>University Time</h3>
  <p>At 6:30 AM, my alarm rings on again, indicating that it's time to prepare for university. I quickly get dressed,<br> take a shower, and get ready for the lengthy ride. I live in Ajman, thus I travel to Ras Al Khaimah, the location<br> of my university, Bath Spa University, using bus at 7:20 AM.

    I reach the university by 9:00 AM after a two-hour trip,<br> and courses begin at 9:30 AM. Since I have only three days a week at my university, my schedule is a little easier to<br> handle during Ramadan. At 12:30 PM, my courses are over, It's 2:00 PM when I finally reach home.</p>
