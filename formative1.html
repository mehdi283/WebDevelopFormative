    <h1>A Regular Ramadan Day in My Life</h1>
    <p>Ramadan is distinguished as a month of self-discipline,<br>
 self-examination and loyalty, which makes it special. In<br>
 order to follow the fasting schedule, I had to completely<br>
  change my daily routine. I am interested to share what my<br>
   days often include during this holy month. </p><br><hr>

    

    
    <h2>Early Morning Suhoor routine </h2>

    <p>In the morning I wake up really early, I wake up at 3AM in the morning and start<br>reciting the Quran till 4:30. It is a beautiful time in the morning for sincere reflection<br>and profound communion. 

        Afterward, I have Suhoor and make certain to eat well so<br> my energy lasts throughout the day; After having Suhoor, I brush my teeth and pray Fajr. Then i<br> sleep till 5:30 AM. </p><br>

  <h3>Getting ready for University</h3>
  <p>At 6:30 AM, I woke up, feeling a little drowsy but eager to get on with my day. After taking a brief shower,<br> I get ready for college.

    Since I live in Ajman, I travel to Ras Al Khaimah, the location of my university, Bath Spa<br> University, by using bus at 7:20 AM. I get there at 9:00 AM after a two-hour drive, right before my lessons start at<br> 9:30 AM.
    
    On class days, I concentrate on studying and maximizing my lectures because I only attend university three days a week.</p><br>

   <h3>Returning Home & Resting</h3>
   <p>At 12:30 PM, my classes are over, and I begin to head home. I eventually reach<br> home around 2:00 PM, feeling grateful however exhausted. To get my energy back for the evening, I pray and then sleep.</p>

   



    <h3>Iftari and Studying Time </h3>
    <p>I woke up at 6:00 PM, shortly before Iftar, and that's the moment I've been waiting for from morning!<br> 
        It's always an enjoyable time for me to break my fast with family and mouthwatering food.
        I study till<br>8:00 PM after eating, being conscious to finish assignments and revise everything. Then, in order to<br> completely immerse myself in the spiritual ambiance of Ramadan nights, I go to the mosque at 8pm for prayers.</p>





    <h3>The food is one of the finest parts of Iftar! Although I appreciate an extensive variety of foods, my favorites are:</h3>





    <ul> 
        <li>Biryani: Spicy and flavorful, it’s always a treat!</li>
        <li>Chicken Korma: Rich, creamy, and full of delicious spices.</li>
        <li>Mutton Namkeen Pulao:  A perfect balance of tender mutton and fragrant rice.</zl>
        <li>Samosas:  Crispy, filled with spicy potatoes or minced meat.</li>
        <li>Fruit Chaat:  A refreshing mix of fruits with a hint of spice.</li>
        <li>Dates and Rooh Afza: A classic way to break my fast!</li>
    </ul>






    <h3>End of The Day</h3>
    <p>Realizing that I'll be getting up again in a few hours to resume this cycle,<br> I'm ready to go sleep by 10:00 PM. The routine is difficult, but it is also extremely<br> worthwhile. It takes discipline to balance fasting, prayers, and university life, but<br> Ramadan serves as a reminder of the value of patience, faith, and awareness.</p><br>





    <h4>My days throughout this holy month are like this: they are full of dedication, thankfulness, and purpose.</h4>
